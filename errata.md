## Chapter 04, Page 2 - Fixing the equals syntax in an `if` statement

The example of an `if` statement here explains how a single `=` sign is true. It should be `if(hobby = "coding")`

Incorrect code is:
```
if(hobby == "coding"){
  console.log("** I love coding too! **");
} else {
  console.log("** Can you teach me that? **");
}
```
Correct code is:
```
if(hobby = "coding"){
  console.log("** I love coding too! **");
} else {
  console.log("** Can you teach me that? **");
}
```

## Chapter 14, Page 379 - Replaced `Exercise 14.4` with correct solution
Solution for [Exercise 14.4](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/JavaScript-from-Beginner-to-Professional/blob/main/Chapter%2014/Exercise_14.4.html) is now fixed.
